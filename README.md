# CS-255-System-Analysis-and-Design

•	Who was the client? What type of system did they want you to design?

The client was DriverPass. A company that wants to increase the pass rate of new drivers. They wanted to do this though some online tests and scheduling several on the road lessons.

 
•	What did you do particularly well?

I feel I completed the business requirements document very well. I enjoyed reading the interview we were given and picking each part that could be important and how to accomplish that goal.


•	If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?

I think my use case UML could be simplified and streamlined. I would go back to thinking of what is really necessary and what is implied and remove many of the relationship lines to make it clearer to read. 


•	How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your system design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

We were provided with an interview document to read and find the needs. So, I read, re-read, and re-read that document. Then I started thinking if I was that user what would I want according to what the company required. That helped me to think of what I typically interact with and what would be neat to me. Its important because if there is something that is not very useful then why spend time programming it? Also, if there is something that wasn’t mentioned but would be important to a user, why not suggest it as a feature? That is how you get users to like your work. The more users that like what you do, the more you will be key to the operations. 


•	How do you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a system?

I approach designing software from a user’s standpoint. I like to think if I were a user and ask things like what would I expect to see? What would be awesome to have? What would be intuitive to use? Then look at every requirement. Each sentence a person uses can convey many requirements. Listening very carefully to clients and thinking from a user’s standpoint is the way to fully meet everyone’s expectations. I would continue to use interviews and user experience meetings to find what a person would really expect and what the client requires for their system. I am a pretty good people person who likes to listen when asking questions and finding what people really need. So I am very confident that I could continue to find what a client requires as well as what a user expects, though my interactions with them.
